  # Project brief Task 4 PARSE / VISUALIZE IN PYTHON A CSV FILE

Using Pycharm an IDE for python, which is a high-tech programming language, allowing users to programme on both smaller and larger scales. The project iam working on is task 4 where I will be modifying and manipulating my own CSV file in various iffrent ways by creating diffrent codes. An csv text file stands for Comma separated value where each line in the file contains data. Within my organisation I will be having a small meeting, hence why I have imputed some information of my workers within my csv file, so wwith this file i will be creating codes which each of the code will excecute a diffrent task. So for example a code to to add additional information to the file, known as "Appending" the file, create codes to extract certain data, write the same file changing the delimeter making the data within the file readble to the eye and the code will demonstate a way user can change the way data is stored in a csv. I will be working with pyhton Libraries such as Matplotlib, numpy and pandas to plot certain data from my csv. Overall my project will ensure that the fundamentals of handiling a CSV file and conducting a statistical and data anaylsis using python comes through.
