# Boardmeetings / CSV File

PARSE / VISUALIZE IN PYTHON A CSV FILE

Using python, a high-tech programming language, allowing users to programme on both smaller and larger scales. I have created my own csv file which I will then be modifying and analysing within this language program, with the help of another program known as PyCharm, which is an integrated environment platform used to run codes within python.

__Required programs__

•	Latest version of python / https://www.python.org/downloads/

•	PyCharm Community IDE-https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
