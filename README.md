# Boardmeetings / CSV File

  __PARSE / VISUALIZE IN PYTHON A CSV FILE__

Using python, a high-tech programming language, allowing users to programme on both smaller and larger scales. I have created my own csv file which I will then be modifying and analysing within this language program, with the help of another program known as PyCharm, which is an integrated environment platform used to run codes within python.

  __A CSV FILE__
  
An csv text file stands for Comma separated value where each line in the file contains data.

  __Required programs__

•	Latest version of python / https://www.python.org/downloads/

•	PyCharm Community IDE-https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
