# Boardmeetings - CSV FILE

  __PARSE / VISUALIZE IN PYTHON A CSV FILE__

Using python, a high-tech programming language, allowing users to programme on both smaller and larger scales. I have created my own csv file which I will then be modifying and analysing within this language program, with the help of another program known as PyCharm, which is an integrated environment platform used to run codes within python.

  __CSV FILE__
An csv text file stands for Comma separated value where each line in the file contains data , though within the file at the start each value is separated by a comma later on within python, Within my organisation I will be having individual meetings, hence why I have imputed some emails within my csv file, however to add additional information and parse I will create a python script and commands.
